Resources for Drupal Meetup Organizers
======================================

If you've arrived here from the DrupalCon Munich session [To Beer or Not To Beer](http://munich2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/beer-or-not-beer-making-meetups-work), welcome! If you didn't, you can follow that link after August 23rd (give or take) to see video from our panel discussion. In either case, we hope that you find the following resources helpful.

Advice for Organizers
---------------------
In the summer of 2012, Paul Johnson [conducted a survey](http://stuffly.posterous.com/what-makes-for-a-successful-drupal-meetup) of Drupal meetup organizers, and asked for advice for people planning a meetup. These were the most common recommendations:

- Just do it! (this was definitely the most common phrase, by a long shot) You don't need permission to start a meetup group. Drupal is a volunteer-driven community, so take the reigns and make it happen.
- Be consistent about scheduling. Pick a date—like the third Tuesday every month, for example—and stick to it. People like to know when the events will happen, and are more likely to attend if they can just put a repeating event in their calendar.
- Focus on beginners: make sure that new Drupal users and developers are welcome at your meetups. Try to plan sessions or talks geared toward them. Your meetup will likely have plenty of Drupal veterans, but people who are completely new to Drupal will be interested to learn more about it to determine whether it's something they want to get into.
- Don't try to organize alone: find one or two other people willing to help out so things don't fall apart when one person gets busy with a big project.
- Publicize outside of g.d.o: people often don't find out about groups.drupal.org until they've been using Drupal for months. Post your event there, but also advertise it elsewhere. For example, a lot of people use Meetup.com and will look there for Drupal events.
- Contact local companies about possibly sponsoring the event, to provide pizza and drinks or books to give away.
- Choose an accessible location: make sure it will be easy for people to get to the event (close to public transit, available parking, etc) and that it will be accessible to those with disabilities.
